# Hacker News Analysis

This repository contains notebook where I performed a quick analysis of posts on Hacker News website. The analysis is done using pure Python, without use of Pandas, NumPy or any other 
analysis tools. The main purpose for this was the motivation to remind myself of working with Python's basic structures, for example dictionaries.

In the analysis contained collecting and sorting the data, then celaning and other preparation for analysis. 

#### Main questions I wanted to be answered:
- **Do "Ask HN" post or "Show HN" posts receive more comments on average?**
- **Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?**

**Data Used:**

[Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/viliam-gago/hacker_news_posts_analysis/blob/main/hacker_news.csv)

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hack).
